# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built using HTML and CSS.

The goal of this project was to practice:
- Responsive layouts
- Typography and spacing
- Grid and flexbox
- Clean UI structure

Some sections were inspired by common design patterns and references, while others were built through iteration and experimentation.

This project reflects my current learning stage and will continue to evolve as I grow.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Status
Work in progress
